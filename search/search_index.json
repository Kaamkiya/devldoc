About devl Devl was originally supposed to be a command-line app that taught beginners how to do things, and gave them quizzes that they could try. However, it evolved into something very different. It's now a CLI app that has cheat sheets , quizzes , and a ton of resources to help people find anything they might need help with while coding. Devl stands for dev eloper l earning. Only afterward did I realize that I had a perfect icon \ud83d\udc7f. Also, because I hate them with a passion, devl comes with zero dependencies. All the APIs used are hosted online, and after installation, there is no need for anything other than the executable that was generated.

Adding to $PATH To get started with devl, first make sure that the executable is in your path. This allows you to use it just by typing devl instead of /path/to/devl . On Linux/Unix/MacOS, adding devl to your path looks like this: export PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/.devl\" Getting started Type the following command into your terminal/command prompt: devl That should output a message on how to use it. Now try this: devl help That will output a much more detailed and descriptive explanation of how to use it. If you like getting your hands dirty, play with the tips it gives you. Here's the rest anyway. devl help This prints a help message, as we saw above. If you put something after the help parameter, it prints help for that, or gives you an error message. devl quiz This command will quiz you on whatever you like. To see all of the quizzes, type this command: devl help quiz This should print how to use it and list all available quizzes. When you type this command (with and argument), a question will be printed. You can then enter your answer, in the form of a letter. Beware , though, that the input you give is not verifiead, so it'll just be considered wrong. Use this command to get quizzed: devl quiz <language> Try it! devl resource This command provides a list of resources for whatever you enter. This is probably the best and easiest thing to contribute to, so make a PR and add some resources to resources.json! To learn about the command, type this: devl help resource That'll print how to use it. To try it, type this: devl resource go That should output a list of resources about the Go coding language. To use it in the future, type the following: devl resource <thing> Where <thing> is whatever you need help with. Some other examples: devl resource oop # provide resources explaining OOP devl resource vuejs devl resource c++ devl cheatsheet This fetches a cheatsheet and prints it. It currently gets the sheets from Learn X in Y minutes . If it exists in the LearnXinYminutes repo , you can just type the following: devl cheatsheet <language> Some examples: devl cheatsheet c++ devl cheatsheet asymptotic-notation","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"usage/#using-devl","text":"If you haven't already installed devl , do that first.","title":"Using devl"},{"location":"usage/#adding-to-path","text":"To get started with devl, first make sure that the executable is in your path.
