# Welcome to devl

Devl is a CLI app to teach coding, and provide resources and cheat sheets for
all possible needs. 

## About devl

Devl was originally supposed to be a 
[command-line app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Console_application) that
taught beginners how to do things, and gave them quizzes that they could try.
However, it evolved into something *very* different. It's now a CLI app that
has **cheat sheets**, 
[**quizzes**](https://github.com/Kaamkiya/devl/tree/main/quizzes), and a ton of
[**resources**](https://github.com/Kaamkiya/devl/blob/main/resources.json) to 
help people find anything they might need help with while coding.

Devl stands for **dev**eloper **l**earning. Only afterword did I realize that I had
a perfect icon :smile:
